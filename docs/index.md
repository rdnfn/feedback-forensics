# Feedback Forensics Docs

Welcome to the docs for **Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to measure AI personality changes**. Beyond raw capabilities, *model personality traits*, such as tone and sycophancy, also matter to users. Feedback Forensics can help you track *(1) personality changes encouraged by your human (or AI) feedback datasets* ([tutorial](guide/feedback.ipynb)), and *(2) personality traits exhibited by your AI models* ([tutorial](guide/models.ipynb)).
